    <h1>Solitaire</h1>
    <p>
        Klondike is a card game for one player and the best known and most popular version of the patience or solitaire family,
        as well as one of the most challenging in widespread play. The four foundations are built up by suit from Ace 
         King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors. 
        Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile, can be moved, 
        as a unit, to another tableau pile on the basis of its highest card. 
        Any empty piles can be filled with a King, or a pile of cards with a King. 
        The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, 
        all of the same suit, on one of the four foundations, at which time the player would have won.
